## Your Choice
**Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL API – Serverless tier)**

## Justification
Azure Cosmos DB with the NoSQL API is the best choice for storing JSON analysis results generated by a serverless Azure Function. It natively stores and indexes JSON documents without requiring a predefined schema, which aligns well with flexible analysis outputs. The serverless tier follows a pay-per-request model, making it cost-effective for spiky or low-volume student workloads. It integrates seamlessly with Azure Functions and has a mature Python SDK, enabling simple read/write operations and efficient querying of historical results when needed.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Azure Table Storage**: Although inexpensive and schemaless, it offers very limited query capabilities and is best suited for simple key-value lookups rather than querying JSON fields.
- **Azure SQL Database**: While it supports JSON columns and powerful queries, it requires schema design and ongoing management, which adds unnecessary complexity and cost for a serverless, JSON-centric use case.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Suitable for cheap storage of raw JSON files, but it lacks native query and indexing capabilities, making it impractical for querying or filtering analysis results directly.

## Cost Considerations
Azure Cosmos DB offers a **Free Tier** that includes a monthly allowance of throughput and storage, which is ideal for student projects. In addition, the **serverless tier** charges only for the request units consumed by operations and for storage used, with no upfront or provisioned capacity costs. This makes it highly cost-efficient for infrequent or unpredictable workloads typical of serverless applications.
